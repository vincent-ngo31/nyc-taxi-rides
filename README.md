# NYC Taxi Rides: Predicting Ride Duration
Python, SQL, scikit-learn, Pandas, matplotlib

## Project 2a

**Part 1**: Mined NYC taxi ride data by querying database using SQLite. Conducted exploratory data analysis, inspection, and cleaning using SQL. Created training and validation datasets for future use. 

**Part 2**: Continued exploration on training dataset. Visualized and analyzed time, distance, and spatial/locational features. Implemented clustering analysis to pinpoint more nuanced features.

## Project 2b

**Part 3**: Conducted EDA on NYC taxi accident data. Focused on features similar to those in Part 2.

**Part 4**: Completed feature engineering and constructed regression model for the purpose of predicting the duration of an NYC taxi ride based on given information. Fit the model on training data, validated, and tested. Built reusable data processing pipeline. Model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 266, meaning it was off by roughly 3-5 minutes on trips of average length 12 minutes.
